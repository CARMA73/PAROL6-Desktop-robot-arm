PAROL6 is high performance 3D printed desktop robotic arm. Design aproach of PAROL6 was to be similar to industrial robots in terms of mechanical design, control software and usability. Control software, GUI and robots STL files are open-source. You can build your own PAROL6 robot by following instructions on this page.

# How to start

To build this robotic arm follow [Building instructions](https://github.com/PCrnjak/Faze4-Robotic-arm/blob/master/Assembly%20instructions%203.1.pdf). All general info about robotic arm is in [DOCS](https://faze4-robotic-arm-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Building instructions and DOCS go hand in hand and you need to follow both to build this arm. Building instructions are about general mechanical assembly while DOCS contain ALL info ( Electrical wiring, Low level setup, High level ROS and Matlab, tips ...).

# Support the project

All the code and STL files needed to build the robot are Open source and free to all and I would like to keep it that way, so any help 
in terms of donations, advice or contribution is really appreciated. Thank you!
