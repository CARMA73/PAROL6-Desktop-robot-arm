PAROL6 is a high-performance 3D-printed desktop robotic arm. The design approach of PAROL6 was to be similar to industrial robots in terms of mechanical design, control software, and usability. Control software, GUI, and robots STL files are open-source. You can build your own PAROL6 robot by following the instructions on this page.

# How to start building?

To build this robotic arm follow [Building instructions](https://github.com/PCrnjak/Faze4-Robotic-arm/blob/master/Assembly%20instructions%203.1.pdf). All general info about the robotic arm is in [DOCS](https://faze4-robotic-arm-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Building instructions and DOCS go hand in hand and you need to follow both to build and use this arm. Building instructions are about general mechanical assembly while DOCS contain ALL info ( Electrical wiring, Low-level setup, High-level ROS and Matlab, tips ...).

# Support the project

All the code and STL files needed to build the robot are Open source and free to all and I would like to keep it that way. Any help 
in terms of donations, advice, or contribution is really appreciated. Thank you!
